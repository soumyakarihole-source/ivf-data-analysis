Power BI Dashboards.

This folder contains Power BI (.pbix) files created for visualizing
key insights from the IVF dataset.

Dashboards focus on:
- Patient and treatment overview
- IVF cycle outcomes (clinical pregnancy, live birth)
- Key trends and comparisons
- Outcome-based visual analysis

These dashboards are built using cleaned and processed data
and are intended for exploratory and reporting purposes.
